# Automatic Agent Memory Usage

This file has been split into focused, composable rule files to comply with the 500-line limit per rule. The content is now organized as follows:

## Rule Files

1. **`auto-memory-core.mdc`** - Core workflow and essential operations
   - Essential "always do" rules
   - Basic conflict detection
   - Session and conversation management
   - Storage operations (guidelines, knowledge, tools)

2. **`auto-memory-advanced.mdc`** - Advanced features and tools
   - Additional memory tools (org, file_lock, task, voting, analytics, etc.)
   - Advanced conflict resolution
   - Periodic maintenance tasks
   - Error handling

3. **`auto-memory-examples.mdc`** - Usage examples and workflows
   - All 11 workflow examples
   - Memory population triggers
   - Project setup guide

4. **`auto-memory-reference.mdc`** - Complete tool reference
   - All 20 memory tools documentation
   - Query patterns
   - Common operations

5. **`auto-memory-strategies.mdc`** - Advanced optimization strategies
   - Context-aware querying
   - Confidence-based conflict resolution
   - Learning from analytics
   - Semantic similarity
   - Proactive context loading

## Quick Start

For essential operations, see `auto-memory-core.mdc`. This file is set to `alwaysApply: true` and contains the core workflow that should be followed in every conversation.

For detailed tool usage, see `auto-memory-reference.mdc`.

For examples and common workflows, see `auto-memory-examples.mdc`.
