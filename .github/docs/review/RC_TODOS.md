# RC Todos

Based on the current `docs/review/RC_CODEBASE_REVIEW_REPORT.md`, the remaining work is non-code/process:

- [ ] **Cut an actual RC commit**: clean working tree and ensure CI is reproducible from a single SHA.
- [ ] **Confirm non-code checklist items** in `docs/review/MUST_FIX_BEFORE_MVP_RC.md` are complete (release checklist, packaging/publish process, deployment runbook if applicable).
